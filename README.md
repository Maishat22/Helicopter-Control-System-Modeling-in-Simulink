# Helicopter-Control-System-Modeling-in-Simulink
I recently constructed a helicopter control system model in Simulink, focusing on separate controls for top and tail rotors.
Key steps included:
Initial Setup: Modeled with desired angular velocity set to zero and top-rotor torque 
𝑇𝑡(𝑡)=0.5𝑢(𝑡)
Controller Gain Adjustments:
Set 𝐾=10 and observed angular velocity changes over time.
Increased K to 100 and reported new angular velocity changes.
Additionally, we explored how remote control of 𝐾 can be a vulnerability, potentially exploited to destabilize the helicopter.
